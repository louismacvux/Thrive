# Thrive Application Vision Statement 

Thrive will provide quick and easy access to multi-faceted tools and information that will assist the consumer in optimizing their health, well-being and performance. The application aims to strike a balance between providing a range of both personalized and generic features that are instrumental for the consumer to excel and thrive. This brings us back to our mission statement, summarizing the premise of the application. "Why settle for survival, when you can be thriving!"

The application combines elements from areas of health, stress management and organization. Some of the personalized features of Thrive include workout plans, optimal food choices, blood work analysis and BMI / maintenance calories calculator. In addition, Thrive will offer more generic features including Thrive stress management tools, workout and meal timing reminders, goal checklists, dashboard for consumers to store information and a calendar for tracking workouts. For personalized features, users will first have to go through a setup process in which their relevant information is entered. The various inputs for the personalized features that will be collected from the user include their age, height, current weight, activity levels, key blood health markers, diet restrictions and favorite foods just to name a few. The described inputs help put in perspective the scope of personalization Thrive will offer to the consumers. 

The application is primarily designed for individuals concerned with their health and productivity, thus looking to track their health information altogether and improve their overall health. Although Thrive is expected to be utilized by individuals of all age, Millennials and Generation Z are most likely going to be the largest demographic for this app since these groups tend to find themselves in more of a time crunch as the world gets faster paced and they end up inadvertently neglecting their health and other key elements of day to day life. Thrive is also a perfect fit for most fitness enthusiasts as it will allow them to access vital tools that are necessary in physical performance and maintaining / improving ones energy levels. In addition, as the demand for greater autonomy goes up exponentially in all facets of life, people are looking more than ever towards resources / applications that will enable them and empower them. Thrive is a perfect candidate for this growing segment of the market. 

Thrive will be valuable to anyone requiring some direction in achieving their health and wellness related goals; whether it's regarding losing weight, improving athletic performance or simply managing their nutritional requirements. It provides users with the convenience of having a spectrum of self improvement features, most of which are personalized to the user, laid out for them to use in an easy to use, user friendly interface. What also gives us a unique edge over any possible competitors in this space is how Thrive is able to uniquely group different areas of self development in a harmonious fashion. Eliminating the need for juggling between multiple applications and sources of information will allow the consumer to enjoy a great deal of convenience and quality resources all in our application. 

## The success criteria of our project will be based on the following criteria being met:
* Users enter over 50% of the possible personalized health-related fields. This will measure if the app is serving its intended purpose,
* Users are using the application after 14 days of having initially accessing/downloading it.
* At least one-third of users would recommend the application to friends and family.
* After 30 days of use, users report an improvement of either their physical, mental or overall wellbeing.
