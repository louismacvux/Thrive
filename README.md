## Branching Strategy
Git Flow model or the successfull Git branching model.<br/>
We have the two main branches which are master and development. <br/>

* master : production-ready
* development : source code of the latest changes to the application<br/>

All of the other branches for feature development will branch off from the development branch and be merged to development. Then the project in development will be pushed to master once it is ready to be released.
