                  The velocity chart for our project elaborates how much work was completed compared to 
                  how much work was committed. Work here refers to the sum of the number of features, number of user stories, 
                  and implementation of the database. Overall, our estimation of the amount of work to be completed improved with experience. 
                  We learned from our completed work from iteration 1 and anticipated to complete 5 "work."
                  The reason the committed work in iteration 3 was less than the actual work completed in iteration 2 was 
                  because the chart does not include other parts of the project such as project presentation. Taking other parts of the 
                  project and the same due dates into account, our team consented on focusing more on quality than new features.

                  <p>Throughout the development of this project, I have learned how important it is for team members to 
                    regularly meet a s group. When we were able to communicate directly with each other at set intervals, 
                    the momentum of the project was well maintained. I have also learned about this importance of solid 
                    design principles. Following the principles more strictly has reduced coding inconsistencies between 
                    team members.</p>

                  <p>I have come to learn the importance of time managment. While taking on a challenging task such as developing an app
                    and other challenges in your life at the same time, management becomes a key factor in your success.
                    I also learned how important writing "good" "non-smelly" code is. If you plan out your coding,
                    you will have less to refractor later on which can become time consuming. I learned how to work with a team 
                    in a real-world situation and have understood that communication is always a very important aspect when working with a team.</p>

                  <p>This project has taught me how important it is to code "well" from the beginning. Good, well planned, 
                    structured code will prevent technical debts in the future and will reduce time put into refactoring code. 
                    Hence, I truly realized the significance of the SOLID design principles. 
                    This project gave me a lesson that coding under this principle will end up with a good code. 
                    I also learned so much about the differnt types of tests and why they are all critical to an extent.</p>

                    others as a team. I have also learned that make my code works is not enough, but make it works prudently 
                    is also very important. The design principles that I learned and applied to this project are definitely 
                    a great tool for my future coding.</p>

                    It is uplifting that from nothing to a working application. Moreover, it is the best experience for me to 
                    learn how to work with others as a team. It tells me how the real application development look like. 
                    I am glad that our development process was quite smooth. I think the techniques such as software architecture 
                    pattern and different types of testing I learned are particularly useful if I have real application development

              <p>At the end of iteration 2, we experienced some minor shortcomings. 
                There were some solid violations in our code that needed to be refactored 
                and we had issues with the integration tests not being complete due to not 
                having a working real database in place to support the tests. During our 
                iteration 3, we had the database implementation as our high priority task and 
                completed it and had the team review the code to avoid code smells.</p>
              <strong>• What went wrong in the development process?</strong><br/>
              We had some problems in iteration 1, where we had documentation requirements that were not satisfied and very weak test suites.<br/><br/>
              <strong>• What went right in the development process?</strong><br/>
              Transitioning from our first iteration, we decided to have more frequent team meetings with improved communication to check up on our progress and make sure all the delegated tasks were being met as planned.<br/><br/>
              <strong>• What would you do differently, if you had the chance to start over?</strong><br/>
              We would narrow down our focus on the quality of the features rather than the quantity and plan the coding thoroughly before jumping in to reduce technical debt.<br/><br/>
              <strong>• What did you learn about team or large project development? What will you start doing or keep doing?</strong><br/>
              If everyone on the team is willing to make things work, team work can be highly efficient as compared to working individually. We will continue to improve the organizational skills and communication which are the keys to a team project.
